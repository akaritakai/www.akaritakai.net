## Hello!

I'm Justin and welcome to my website. ^_^

This started out as a combination of two personal projects: building a statically generated blog from markdown files
(inspired by [this blog post](https://xeiaso.net/blog/new-language-blog-backend-2022-03-02)), and then deploying
it with a CI/CD pipeline on commit. While the underlying tech is really what interests me, I plan on expanding this site
soon to include more content, blog posts, and features.

## About Me

I'm effervescently silly and a giant nerd, but I'd have to be; my job involves tricking rocks into thinking after
shocking them with electricity.

While I'm not doing _that_, I have a variety of hobbies and interests, some of which I discuss on my [blog](/blog/).

## Interests

Here are (only a tiny subset!) of my interests:

- Auto Racing
- Flight Simulation
- Computer Science
- Math
- Puzzles
- Cartoons
- Anime
- Music Transcription
- PC Video Games
